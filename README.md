## Whys and Wherefores

1. *The Database*: Since actual payment processing will be "added later", I have opted not to store the users' credit card information for security reasons. If this ever becomes necessary, it can always be added on, but as it stands, it's in everyone's best interest to avoid holding onto payment information. This makes validations a bit trickier, but is ultimately worth it.
